# 🧪 Flotation Column Control System – LabVIEW GUI

This repository documents the development of a **supervisory control and instrumentation system**
for a **pilot-scale column flotation process**, implemented as part of my
**Master’s thesis in Electrical Engineering (2018)**.

The project integrates **decoupled MIMO control using PID loops**, **industrial automation**,
**data acquisition**, and **graphical supervision**, representing an applied control solution
for mineral processing experimentation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The system was designed to regulate and supervise two strongly coupled process variables:

- **Liquid level (h)** inside the flotation column  
- **Gas holdup (ε_g)**  

using a **decoupled MIMO control structure**, implemented as
independent **PID control loops** after interaction analysis.

Real-time visualization, supervision, and actuation were achieved
through industrial communication and laboratory instrumentation.

</p>

High-level architecture of the control system:

- **Supervisory layer:** LabVIEW GUI (control, visualization, logging)  
- **Control & actuation:** PLC Siemens S7-1200  
- **Communication:** OPC server (LabVIEW ↔ PLC)  
- **Instrumentation:** NI USB-6002 DAQ  
- **Process:** Pilot-scale flotation column  

This architecture enabled real-time interaction between laboratory
instrumentation and industrial automation components.

## 🔁 Control Strategy (Decoupled MIMO)

### Process Variables Definition

The following variables are used in the control block diagram:


- $$h$$: Pulp level inside the flotation column
- $$Q_p$$: Pulp flow rate (manipulated variable for level control)
- $$Q_g$$: Gas flow rate (manipulated variable for gas holdup control)
 $$\varepsilon_g$$: Gas holdup (gas phase volume fraction)

The system is modeled as a **2×2 MIMO process** with:

- Inputs: $$Q_p$$ ; $$Q_g$$
- Outputs: $$h$$ ; $$\varepsilon_g$$

Interaction between the loops motivated the use of a **decoupled control structure**.

The implemented control strategy consists of:

- Interaction analysis of the MIMO process  
- Decoupling of the control structure  
- Independent **PID controllers** for:
  - Liquid level  
  - Gas holdup  
- Continuous-time PID tuning implemented in LabVIEW  
- Actuation through **peristaltic pumps** driven by the PLC  

This approach simplifies controller design while preserving acceptable
performance under experimental operating conditions.

## 🖥️ Graphical User Interface

</p>

The LabVIEW-based GUI provides:

- Real-time visualization of process variables  
- Manual and automatic (PID) operation modes  
- Independent setpoint adjustment for each control loop  
- Monitoring of control signals  
- Data acquisition and logging  

The interface was developed for experimental usability
and process supervision rather than commercial HMI deployment.

</p>

The control system was validated on a **pilot-scale flotation column**,
allowing:

- Experimental testing of decoupled MIMO control strategies  
- Observation of interaction effects and disturbance rejection  
- Integration of sensing, control, and supervision in a real process environment  

This confirms the applied and experimental nature of the work beyond simulation.
