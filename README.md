# 🧪 Flotation Column Control System – LabVIEW HMI

This repository documents the development of a **supervisory control and instrumentation system**
for a **pilot-scale column flotation process**, implemented as part of my
**Master’s thesis in Electrical Engineering (2018)**.

The project integrates **decoupled MIMO control using PID loops**, **industrial automation**,
**data acquisition**, and **graphical supervision**, representing an applied control solution
for mineral processing experimentation.

> Execution requires legacy software, drivers, and hardware.


## 🎯 Project Overview

The system was designed to regulate and supervise two strongly coupled process variables:

- **Liquid level (h)** inside the flotation column  
- **Gas holdup (ε_g)**  

using a **decoupled MIMO control structure**, implemented as
independent **PID control loops** after interaction analysis.

Real-time visualization, supervision, and actuation were achieved
through industrial communication and laboratory instrumentation.

The pilot-scale experimental setup corresponds to a **column flotation process
for copper extraction**, providing the physical context for the control
architecture shown above.


High-level architecture of the control system:

- **Supervisory layer:** LabVIEW GUI (control, visualization, logging)  
- **Control & actuation:** PLC Siemens S7-1200  
- **Communication:** OPC server (LabVIEW ↔ PLC)  
- **Instrumentation:** NI USB-6002 DAQ  
- **Process:** Pilot-scale flotation column  

This architecture enabled real-time interaction between laboratory
instrumentation and industrial automation components.



## 🔁 Control Strategy (Decoupled MIMO)

### Process Variables Definition

The following variables are used in the control block diagram:


- $$h$$: Pulp level inside the flotation column
- $$Q_p$$: Pulp flow rate (manipulated variable for level control)
- $$Q_g$$: Gas flow rate (manipulated variable for gas holdup control)
 $$\varepsilon_g$$: Gas holdup (gas phase volume fraction)

The system is modeled as a **2×2 MIMO process** with:

- Inputs: $$Q_p$$ ; $$Q_g$$
- Outputs: $$h$$ ; $$\varepsilon_g$$

Interaction between the loops motivated the use of a **decoupled control structure**.

The implemented control strategy consists of:

- Interaction analysis of the MIMO process  
- Decoupling of the control structure  
- Independent **PID controllers** for:
  - Liquid level  
  - Gas holdup  
- Continuous-time PID tuning implemented in LabVIEW  
- Actuation through **peristaltic pumps** driven by the PLC  

This approach simplifies controller design while preserving acceptable
performance under experimental operating conditions.

The decoupling strategy was guided by the interaction analysis obtained
from the preliminary modeling stage.


## 🖥️ HMI

The LabVIEW-based HMI provides:
From a software perspective, the interface is implemented as a graphical user interface (GUI); however, functionally it operates as a process HMI intended for supervision and control.

</p>

The LabVIEW-based GUI provides:

- Real-time visualization of process variables  
- Manual and automatic (PID) operation modes  
- Independent setpoint adjustment for each control loop  
- Monitoring of control signals  
- Data acquisition and logging  

The interface was developed for experimental usability
and process supervision rather than commercial HMI deployment.


## 🧪 Pilot-Scale Experimental Setup

</p>

The control system was validated on a **pilot-scale flotation column**,
allowing:

- Experimental testing of decoupled MIMO control strategies  
- Observation of interaction effects and disturbance rejection  
- Integration of sensing, control, and supervision in a real process environment  

This confirms the applied and experimental nature of the work beyond simulation.

## 📄 Related Publication (Preliminary System Modeling)

The following conference publication presents a **preliminary dynamic modeling**
of the flotation column system:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8609809/

The publication focuses on:
- Preliminary dynamic modeling of the flotation column  
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis of variable interaction  
- Identification of the MIMO nature of the process  

The model should be understood as a **first- and second-order approximation**
intended to support interaction analysis and control structure selection.

The **control strategy and supervisory implementation** documented in this repository
were developed based on this preliminary modeling and subsequent experimental insight,
and are **not covered in the paper itself**.
